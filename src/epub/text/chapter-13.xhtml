			<h3 epub:type="title">ALONG THE FRONT OF THE ICEBERGS.</h3>
		</hgroup>
		<p>Although the seas beyond the Polar Circle were wildly tumultuous, it is but just to acknowledge that our
			navigation had been accomplished so far under exceptional conditions. And what good luck it would be if the
			<i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Halbrane</i>, in this first fortnight of December, were to find the
			Weddell route open!
		</p>
		<p>There! I am talking of the Weddell route as though it were a macadamized road, well kept, with mile-stones
			and “This way to the South Pole” on a signpost!</p>
		<p>The numerous wandering masses of ice gave our men no trouble; they were easily avoided. It seemed likely that
			no real difficulties would arise until the schooner should have to try to make a passage for herself through
			the icebergs.</p>
		<p>Besides, there was no surprise to be feared. The presence of ice was indicated by a yellowish tint in the
			atmosphere, which the whalers called “blink.” This is a phenomenon peculiar to the glacial zones which never
			deceives the observer.</p>
		<p>For five successive days the Halbrane sailed without sustaining any damage, without having, even for a
			moment, had to fear a collision. It is true that in proportion as she advanced towards the south the number
			of icepacks increased and the channels became narrower. On the 14th an observation gave us 72° 7′ for
			latitude, our longitude remaining the same, between the forty-second and the forty-third meridian. This was
			already a point beyond the Antarctic Circle that few navigators had been able to reach. We were at only two
			degrees lower than Weddell.</p>
		<p>The navigation of the schooner naturally became a more delicate matter in the midst of those dim, wan masses
			soiled with the excreta of birds. Many of them had a leprous look: compared with their already considerable
			volume, how small our little ship, over whose mast some of the icebergs already towered, must have appeared!
		</p>
		<p>Captain Len Guy admirably combined boldness and prudence in his command of his ship. He never passed to
			leeward of an iceberg, if the distance did not guarantee the success of any manoeuvre whatsoever that might
			suddenly become necessary. He was familiar with all the contingencies of ice-navigation, and was not afraid
			to venture into the midst of these flotillas of drifts and packs. That day he said to me⁠—</p>
		<p>“<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeorling; this is not the first time that I have tried to penetrate into the Polar Sea, and
			without
			success. Well, if I made the attempt to do this when I had nothing but presumption as to the fate of the <i
				epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Jane</i> to go upon, what shall I not do now that presumption is changed
			into certainty?”</p>
		<p>“I understand that, captain, and of course your experience of navigation in these waters must increase our
			chances of success.”</p>
		<p>“Undoubtedly. Nevertheless, all that lies beyond the fixed icebergs is still the unknown for me, as it is for
			other navigators.”</p>
		<p>“The Unknown! No, not absolutely, captain, since we possess the important reports of Weddell, and, I must
			add, of Arthur Pym also.”</p>
		<p>“Yes, I know; they have spoken of the open sea.”</p>
		<p>“Do you not believe that such a sea exists?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, I do believe that it exists, and for valid reasons. In fact, it is perfectly manifest that these
			masses, called icebergs and ice-fields, could not be formed in the ocean itself. It is the tremendous and
			irresistible action of the surge which detaches them from the continents or islands of the high latitudes.
			Then the currents carry them into less cold waters, where their edges are worn by the waves, while the
			temperature disintegrates their bases and their sides, which are subjected to thermometric influences.”</p>
		<p>“That seems very plain,” I replied. “Then these masses have come from the icebergs. <a
				href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> They clash
			with them in drifting, sometimes break into the main body, and clear their passage through. Again, we must
			not judge the southern by the northern zone. The conditions are not identical. Cook has recorded that he
			never met the equivalent of the Antarctic ice mountains in the Greenland seas, even at a higher latitude.”
		</p>
		<p>“What is the reason?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“No doubt that the influence of the south winds is predominant in the northern regions. Now, those winds do
			not reach the northern regions until they have been heated in their passage over America, Asia, and Europe,
			and they contribute to raise the temperature of the atmosphere. The nearest land, ending in the points of
			the Cape of Good Hope, Patagonia, and Tasmania, does not modify the atmospheric currents.”</p>
		<p>“That is an important observation, captain, and it justifies your opinion with regard to an open sea.”</p>
		<p>“Yes, open⁠—at least, for ten degrees behind the icebergs. Let us then only get through that obstacle, and
			our greatest difficulty will have been conquered. You were right in saying that the existence of that open
			sea has been formally recognized by Weddell.”</p>
		<p>“And by Arthur Pym, captain.”</p>
		<p>“And by Arthur Pym.”</p>
		<p>From the 15th of December the difficulties of navigation increased with the number of the drifting masses.
			The wind, however, continued to be uniformly favourable, showing no tendency to veer to the south. The
			breeze freshened now and then, and we had to take in sail. When this occurred we saw the sea foaming along
			the sides of the ice packs, covering them with spray like the rocks on the coast of a floating island, but
			without hindering their onward march.</p>
		<p>Our crew could not fail to be impressed by the sight of the schooner making her way through these moving
			masses; the new men among them, at least, for the old hands had seen such manoeuvres before. But they soon
			became accustomed to it, and took it all for granted.</p>
		<p>It was necessary to organize the look-out ahead with the greatest care. West had a cask fixed at the head of
			the foremast⁠—what is called a crow’s-nest⁠—and from thence an unremitting watch was kept.</p>
		<p>The 16th was a day of excessive fatigue to the men. The packs and drifts were so close that only very narrow
			and winding passage-way between them was to be found, so that the working of the ship was more than commonly
			laborious.</p>
		<p>Under these circumstances, none of the men grumbled, but Hunt distinguished himself by his activity. Indeed,
			he was admitted by Captain Len Guy and the crew to be an incomparable seaman. But there was something
			mysterious about him that excited the curiosity of them all.</p>
		<p>At this date the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Halbrane</i> could not be very far from the icebergs. If
			she held on in her course in
			that direction she would certainly reach them before long, and would then have only to seek for a passage.
			Hitherto, however, the look-out had not been able to make out between the icebergs an unbroken crest of ice
			beyond the ice-fields.</p>
		<p>Constant and minute precautions were indispensable all day on the 16th, for the helm, which was loosened by
			merciless blows and bumps, was in danger of being unshipped.</p>
		<p>The sea mammals had not forsaken these seas. Whales were seen in great numbers, and it was a fairy-like
			spectacle when several of them spouted simultaneously. With fin-backs and hump-backs, porpoises of colossal
			size appeared, and these Hearne harpooned cleverly when they came within range. The flesh of these creatures
			was much relished on board, after Endicott had cooked it in his best manner.</p>
		<p>As for the usual Antarctic birds, petrels, pigeons, and cormorants, they passed in screaming flocks, and
			legions of penguins, ranged along the edges of the ice-fields, watched the evolutions of the schooner. These
			penguins are the real inhabitants of these dismal solitudes, and nature could not have created a type more
			suited to the desolation of the glacial zone.</p>
		<p>On the morning of the 17th the man in the crow’s-nest at last signalled the icebergs.</p>
		<p>Five or six miles to the south a long dentated crest upreared itself, plainly standing out against the fairly
			clear sky, and all along it drifted thousands of ice-packs. This motionless barrier stretched before us from
			the north-west to the south-east, and by merely sailing along it the schooner would still gain some degrees
			southwards.</p>
		<p>When the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Halbrane</i> was within three miles of the icebergs, she lay-to
			in the middle of a wide basin
			which allowed her complete freedom of movement.</p>
		<p>A boat was lowered, and Captain Len Guy got into it, with the boatswain, four sailors at the oars, and one at
			the helm. The boat was pulled in the direction of the enormous rampart, vain search was made for a channel
			through which the schooner could have slipped, and after three hours of this fatiguing reconnoitring, the
			men returned to the ship. Then came a squall of rain and snow which caused the temperature to fall to
			thirty-six degrees (2° 2′ C. above zero), and shut out the view of the ice-rampart from us.</p>
		<p>During the next twenty-four hours the schooner lay within four miles of the icebergs. To bring her nearer
			would have been to get among winding channels from which it might not have been possible to extricate her.
			Not that Captain Len Guy did not long to do this, in his fear of passing some opening unperceived.</p>
		<p>“If I had a consort,” he said, “I would sail closer along the icebergs, and it is a great advantage to be
			two, when one is on such an enterprise as this! But the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Halbrane</i> is
			alone, and if she were to fail
			us⁠—”</p>

			<br />
			<span class="caption">Four sailors at the oars, and one at the helm</span>
		</p>
		<p>Even though we approached no nearer to the icebergs than prudence permitted, our ship was exposed to great
			risk, and West was constantly obliged to change his trim in order to avoid the shock of an icefield.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, the wind blew from east to north-nor’-east without variation, and it did not freshen. Had a
			tempest arisen I know not what would have become of the schooner⁠—yes, though, I do know too well: she would
			have been lost and all on board of her. In such a case the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Halbrane</i>
			could not have escaped; we must
			have been flung on the base of the barrier.</p>
		<p>After a long examination Captain Len Guy had to renounce the hope of finding a passage through the terrible
			wall of ice. It remained only to endeavour to reach the south-east point of it. At any rate, by following
			that course we lost nothing in latitude; and, in fact, on the 18th the observation taken made the
			seventy-third parallel the position of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Halbrane</i>.</p>
		<p>I must repeat, however, that navigation in the Antarctic seas will probably never be accomplished under more
			felicitous circumstances⁠—the precocity of the summer season, the permanence of the north wind, the
			temperature forty-nine degrees at the lowest; all this was the best of good-fortune. I need not add that we
			enjoyed perpetual light, and the whole twenty-four hours round the sun’s rays reached us from every point of
			the horizon.</p>
		<p>Two or three times the captain approached within two miles of the icebergs. It was impossible but that the
			vast mass must have been subjected to climateric influences; ruptures must surely have taken place at some
			points.</p>
		<p>But his search had no result, and we had to fall back into the current from west to east.</p>
		<p>I must observe at this point that during all our search we never descried land or the appearance of land out
			at sea, as indicated on the charts of preceding navigators. These maps are incomplete, no doubt, but
			sufficiently exact in their main lines. I am aware that ships have often passed over the indicated bearings
			of land. This, however, was not admissible in the case of Tsalal. If the <i
				epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Jane</i> had been able to reach the islands, it was because that portion
			of the Antarctic sea was free, and in so “early” a year, we need not fear any obstacle in that direction.
		</p>
		<p>At last, on the 19th, between two and three o’clock in the afternoon, a shout from the crow’s-nest was heard.
		</p>
		<p>“What is it?” roared West.</p>
		<p>“The iceberg wall is split on the south-east.”</p>
		<p>“What is beyond?”</p>
		<p>“Nothing in sight.”</p>
		<p>It took West very little time to reach the point of observation, and we all waited below, how impatiently may
			be imagined. What if the look-out were mistaken, if some optical delusion?⁠—But West, at all events, would
			make no mistake.</p>
		<p>After ten interminable minutes his clear voice reached us on the deck.</p>
		<p>“Open sea!” he cried.</p>
		<p>Unanimous cheers made answer.</p>
		<p>The schooner’s head was put to the south-east, hugging the wind as much as possible.</p>
		<p>Two hours later we had doubled the extremity of the ice-barrier, and there lay before our eyes a sparkling
			sea, entirely open.<br /></p>
